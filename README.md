# Bus-Depo-Management-System

🚌 Bus Reservation System (Python – Console Based)

📌 Project Overview

This is a console-based Bus Reservation System developed in Python as part of my Computer Science practical project.

The system allows users to:

Search available buses by source, destination, and journey date

View seat layout of selected bus

Select seats manually

Prevent duplicate or already booked seats

Calculate ticket fare

Confirm or cancel booking

Generate booking summary with seat numbers and ticket ID


The project simulates a real-world bus booking workflow using basic Python concepts.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to understand and implement:

Python control structures (loops and conditions)

Lists and dictionaries

User input handling

Simple data validation

Logical flow of a booking system


This project helped me improve my problem-solving and programming fundamentals.
