# 🚌 Bus Reservation System (Python – Console Based)

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a console-based Bus Reservation System developed in Python as part of my Computer Science practical.
The system simulates a real-world bus booking workflow where users can search buses, view seat layouts, select seats, calculate fares, and confirm or cancel bookings.

The project focuses on logic building, data automation, validation, and structured programming, without using any external libraries or databases.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To apply Python fundamentals in a real-life problem
* To automate data generation using loops
* To implement seat booking logic with validation
* To handle user inputs safely and correctly
* To understand how reservation systems work internally

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Console / Command Line Interface (CLI)

(No third-party libraries used)

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Source, destination, and date-based bus search
* Automated bus data generation using loops
* Support for forward and return routes
* Route-based ticket pricing
* Date format validation (DD/MM/YYYY)
* Visual seat map display (4 seats per row)
* Manual seat selection
* Prevention of:
  * Duplicate seat selection
  * Already booked seats
* Ticket fare calculation
* Booking confirmation and cancellation option
* Booking summary with ticket ID

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Clone the repository or download the Python file
3. Open terminal / command prompt
4. Run the program:

python Bus_Depo_Management_System.py

---

## 🔄 Program Flow (High Level)

1. User enters source, destination, and journey date
2. System validates date format
3. Bus data is automatically generated using routes and timings
4. Matching buses are displayed
5. User selects a bus
6. Seat layout is shown
7. User selects seats
8. Seat availability is validated
9. Fare is calculated based on route price
10. User confirms or cancels booking
11. Booking summary is displayed

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

* How to automate repetitive data using loops
* How to validate user input effectively
* How to manage structured data using dictionaries
* How to use nested loops for layout generation
* How booking systems manage seat availability
* How to design clean and logical program flow

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* File or database storage
* Graphical user interface (GUI)
* User login and authentication
* Payment simulation
* Admin panel for managing buses
* Multiple journey dates support
